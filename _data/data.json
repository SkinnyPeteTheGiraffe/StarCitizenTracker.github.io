And the crew of the container ship don't actually unload the containers themselves - there's equipment that does it and there's people that are paid to do that. And I would say that in general in the bigger space ports you would have that same kind of setup where you would have the ability to unload the bigger ships, unload the containers. Potentially we've talked about having the ability for players to play the part of a longshoreman"

Ignoring the render tech for VR itself (which given the work we’ve done, would definitely be a read-and-rewrite job, not a merge-this-file job), making a game properly VR compliant takes a lot of work at the design and testing level regardless of the engine used. We’d probably need to get the framerate up a bit higher too, come to think of it."

I don't know what the strength of the beam will be yet, but assuming that there's one that you can grab hold of, you could fly your ship around and release the asteroid with momentum enough to continue in that direction. So potentially I could see people using the tractor beam in interesting ways for combat. It'll all be physically simulated correctly, think of the tractor beam as a virtual rope, and just like that there'll be limits on how big an object and how much mass you can tow etc."

      "quote": "The way that the communications are gonna work is that it travels our in-fiction communication's speed. Which means that when you're in-system and someone beams a message, it gets beamed at the speed of light, and it gets beamed to a relay station, or a message station. This is in the structured universe where the UEE runs it and there's a lot of infrastructure. So one of these stations is right by a jump point so it gets all the information and then it will launch out a message drone or a messenger ship. It goes through the jump point to the other side, where there's probably another relay station, it's collected, then the data gets beamed across to another relay station and so-on and so-forth if it has to go multiple systems."

And from that high-level simulation we can track the sort of movement, the populations, the progress of AI, in a sort of much higher-level, abstracted way, and of course since that doesn't need to be real time, like you flying around, we can time slice it, which is why we can simulate so many agents."
